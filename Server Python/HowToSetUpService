This document outlines how to setup and configure the Linux Service for TcpServer.py

On a new linux machine you will need to create the .service file (Note this file can be found within the Server directory)
sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/TcpServer-py.service

When the TcpServer-py.service file is open in Vim cope and paste the TcpServer.service info into that file and save

In the directory home/ubuntu/ there should be a text file called SensorLogs.txt And the python script TcpServer.py

Every time you make a modification to the TcpServer.py file you will need to reload the daemon with this command

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

The first time you setup the service file you will need to run this command

sudo systemctl enable TcpServer-py.service


After that you can now run any of the below commands to start, stop and get status
sudo systemctl start TcpServer-py.service
sudo systemctl status TcpServer-py.service
sudo systemctl stop TcpServer-py.service
